I am a shy person and making new friends was really challenging for me. I felt so isolated and did not feel like I belong there. I even thought about dropping out of college at one point because the feeling of loneliness was too much. Fast forward three years, I now can proudly say that I no longer feel isolated. I met some amazing people in the baking decal class and we became best friends! Just remember, everything will be okay in the end. If it\u2019s not okay, it\u2019s not the end.","High School was hard for me because I was constantly bullied because of my fashion choice (the clothes I was wearing) was not accepted. My family is poor, so my parents could not afford to buy me decent clothes. I only wore donated clothes and they looked funny and dorky. People constantly made fun of me and I really had a hard time fitting in. Looking back to my high school experience, I can say that I have learned so much about resilience. I can\u2019t control the financial situation of my family, but I definitely have control over my own emotions and how I feel myself every single day. It really took me a long to learn this important lesson, but I am glad that I did. To whoever is reading, be strong!
